#
#   Finds reasonable path through a grid of squares with obstacles.
#
#   Intermediate step to an implementation in LSL.

#   June, 2019
#
#   The algorithm is classic, and from Wikipedia. 
#
#
#
#   The data for each cell is:
#   - barrier - 1 bit, obstacle present
#   - examined - 1 bit, obstacle presence tested
#
#   These are packed into 2 bits, which are packed 16 per 32 bit word
#   (LSL being a 32-bit system), which are stored in a LSL list.
#   Timing tests indicate that the cost of updating an LSL list is constant up to size 128;
#   then it starts to increase linearly.  So a single list is good enough for anything up
#   to 45x45 cells.

EXAMINED = 0x2

#
#   Data storage.
#
#   This will have to be done with globals in LSL
