#   astar.py  - classic A* pathfinding algorithm
#
#   Finds shortest path through a grid of squares with obstacles.
#
#   Intermediate step to an implementation in LSL.
#
#
#   Animats
#   June, 2019
#
#   The algorithm is classic, and from Wikipedia. The data 
#   structures are unusual, because the purpose of this code
#   is to prepare for translation to Linden Scripting Language.
#   LSL is very limited. The only data structure is an
#   immutable list. We have to work within that limitation.
#
#   The data for each cell is:
#   - barrier - 1 bit, obstacle present
#   - examined - 1 bit, obstacle presence tested
#   - closed - 1 bit, done processing this vertex
#   - camefrom - 3 bits, direction from previous cell
#   - gcost - 10 bits, cost to get here
#
#   These are packed into 16 bits, which are packed two per 32 bit word
#   (LSL being a 32-bit system), which are stored in several LSL lists
#   to keep the list length from becoming too long. Timing tests indicate
#   that the cost of updating an LSL list is constant up to size 128; then
#   it starts to increase linearly. 
#
#   BUGS:
#   1. Route is suboptimal.                                 [FIXED]
#   2. X and Y are reversed in maps so arrows are wrong.    [FIXED]
#   3. New storage system is half-installed.
